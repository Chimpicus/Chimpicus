## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

In 2019 I was encouraged by a close friend to try out programming, this advice lead me to be here today, 3 years deep into a career In software development and I couldn't be mor proud of the progress I'e made. 

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on a file encryption web tool built with Vite, React.js and utilising the Web Crypto API. This i just a proof of concept / portfolio piece. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Vue.js and then Nuxt.js to broaden my frontend scope with the goal of oppening more doors.
