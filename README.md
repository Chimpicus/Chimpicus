## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Case, a self-taught frontend developer, specialising in React, Next.js and Typescript. I secured my first full-time job in 2022, after working unpaid for 6 months to build up some experience. In my current role, I have debugged and fixed a very broken application, rebranded and replaced the Auth solution for the flagship web application and built a greenfields frontend project front the ground up whilst learning and updating my knowledge of Next.js. 

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on a file encryption web tool built with Vite, React.js and utilising the Web Crypto API. This is a hobby project / portfolio piece where I can explore the Web Crypto API, showcase my skills and have some creative freedom.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Vue.js and then Nuxt.js to broaden my frontend scope with the goal of oppening more doors.
